# CS510 HW 2

**Author(s):** **Sharon Kim**

## Specification

1. Continue reviewing the below resources about ```linux/bash```, ```vim```, ```git```, and ```GitHub```. Additional resources are in the info repository as needed. Test what you are learning using the Terminal in CoCalc to make sure you understand it.
    * [Linux/Bash tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) (Sections: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13)
    * [Open Vim Interactive Tutorial](http://openvim.com)
    * [The Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html)
    * [tryGit Interactive Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
1. Complete the classwork, in collaboration with your group (using Slack as needed). 
1. Start reading and working through the following resources on Python to review how Python works, what its syntax is, and how basic control and data structures work. We will be diving into Python coding next week, so be prepared.
    * [Python Interactive Tutorial](http://learnpython.org/)
    * [Getting Started with the Python Language](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/python_language.html)
1. After finishing the classwork, solve number 3 of CW02 (generating temporary files) in 2 more ways, different from how you solved it in the classwork. Save your code in ```createfiles2.sh``` and ```createfiles3.sh```. Comment on the differences between each implementation, and discuss the pros and cons of each approach in the comments. What is the shortest implementation you can find?  Commit your code to GitHub.
1. After finishing the classwork, solve number 5 of CW02, but replace the Fibonacci numbers with the Factorials "1 2 6 24 120 . . . n!". (Recall that the `n`th factorial is defined as $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(3)(2)(1)$. Save your code in ```factorial.sh```.  Commit your code to GitHub.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**After finishing the classwork with the group, I developed 2 more ways to generate and name 100 temporary files.  I saw that there are hundreds of other ways/commands to code for hundreds of different actions.  The first code that works may not always be the best code to save and execute. This realization has reminded me that I need to develop ways to create code that runs efficiently. Creating the factorial.sh code was extremely useful because it introduced the task of creating a function, and using a for loop and the echo command to creatively display the factorial series. After going over the Python tutorials, I am looking forward to seeing the differences between Python and bash shell.**

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
